3. Extra features include Custom Game Modes, Saving All-Time Statistics, AI Technology(Easy and Hard), and DO NOT PRESS button (Not to be pressed under any circumstances)

4. Daniel and Jacob started the project working on getting a basic GUI Mancala board that we could use to kickstart the project. We decided that we wanted a Menu screen that Jacob started work on while Daniel started to figure out the backend design of the Mancala game(How to keep track of marbles, how marbles will move around the board, etc). Daniel was in charge of connecting the classes as well. Jacob set up the statistics for the game and options for creating a custom game interface. Daniel set up the AI (Computer) for the games. Both participants got a chance to assist the other with issues that they were facing and that allowed both of us to work on the many working part of the project. We worked well together and shared responsibility of the project. Communication was great and had regularly scheduled phone calls to talk about progress. We used Github to keep an up to date record of the project.
